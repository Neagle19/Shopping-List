# Shopping-List
Web Scraping Exercise - This program allows users to add items to a shopping list, mark them as purchased, delete items, view their list, or search the website 'Etsy' for ideas. Users are presented with the first five items returned from an Etsy web scrape, and users can add one of those items to their list.
